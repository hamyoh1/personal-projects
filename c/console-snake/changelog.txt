v1.00 - Added initial framework of the game, update and draw functions, printing out a level to the screen.

v1.01 - Added the player, prints correctly to console without misalignment of printed level text.

v1.02 - Added movement to player as well as boundaries to prevent going outside level, once player touches edges player loops around.

v1.03 - Apples now randomly spawn into an array, with a random position governed by the level size.

v1.04 - Apples now draw to console CORRECTLY, movement mimics that of the original Snake game.

v1.05 - Running over apples now removes them from array and increments score.

v1.06 - Player's length added to when apple is eaten, and drawn to console correctly.

v1.07 - Final version, player can now lose, variable width and height applied to level.

Fixed Issues:
- Apples won't draw to console.
- Apples draw to console but shift text across.
- Movement not automatic like real Snake game.


To-Do:
- Add to player's length when apple is eaten.
- Add a way for player to lose (i.e player running into self).
